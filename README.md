# Game Klunk Deliver made in Global Game Jam 2024

About game:
A reality show begins, and our competitor will need a lot of skills with their soft body to deliver things. Jumps have never been so difficult, hitting is a torment, but none of this will be impossible for the winner!

Watch the reactions of the commentators and be careful with your opinions, as they can destroy you. Are you "the shame of the profession"? Spectators will laugh, ads will appear, all to make you laugh and bring joy.

And all this for what? Why not a big pastry and of course... a million (of corn)!

Watch us in this "Klunk Delivery"!

Game engine has developed: Unity 2021.3.31f1
